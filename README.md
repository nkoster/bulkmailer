Send html email with embedded images.

Based on [nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/), which is taking care of
building a message with the images embedded, by formatting the message with content IDs and attachments.

You can read more about this way (and other ways) of sending out email with images here: https://mailtrap.io/blog/embedding-images-in-html-email-have-the-rules-changed/

An email message in html format with embedded images will open without warnings about blocked remote content in most email clients.
That's a big advantage because it improves a recipients user experience and trust.

The message in html format lives inside a directory structure like this:

```
message/
├── images
│   └── bukhanka.png
└── index.html
```

An image tag inside index.html, as in the included example, looks like this:

```html
<body>
  <div>
    <img src="images/bukhanka.png">
  </div>
</body>
```

Bulkmailer will automatically replace any image src value inside the html by its respective attachment content ID.
This means you can freely create an index.html with images, aslong as the images live in the images directory,
and their src value contains the relative image path, like "images/bukhanka.png" in the example.

### Email List

The email list goes into a file named "EmailList.json".

The json file should be structured like this:

```javascript
[
    {
        "name": "John",
        "email": "john@gmail.com"
    },
    {
        "name": "Jane",
        "email": "jane@outlook.com"
    }
]
```

### Install

I am assuming that you're on a linux host with a local mailer like postfix installed.
Bulkmailer is configured to deliver mail at localhost port 25.
Consult the nodemailer [documentation](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/) if you want to change that to something else.

```
git clone https://github.com/nkoster/bulkmailer
cd bulkmailer
npm i
```
Next...

* Make sure your EmailList.json file is in place
* Adjust the message folder content to your needs (index.html and images)
* Adjust the "from", "subject" and "text" fields inside bulkmailer.js to your needs

### Run

```
node bulkmailer.js
```

I use this bulk mailer "in production" to send advertising emails for [drone-existence.com](https://drone-existence.com).

WARNING: This thing is very simple but yet very effective. Use with caution: test very carefuly before applying to a huge email list.

WARNING: To make sure you'll make it through spam filters, you _have to_ run this from a server that sends email from the same domain that is used in the "from" field (inside bulkmailer.js), or a server that's allowed to send email for the domain you're using in the "from" field ([SPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework)).

### More Help

In case you need more help or advice for sending out a bunch of nicely formatted bulk email, let me know.
Perhaps we can work something out. Send a message to niels at w3b dot net.
